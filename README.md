## About me
I am a student at the [Computer Science Engineering](https://www.cs.uoi.gr) department at the [University of Ioannina](https://www.uoi.gr/). I am programming apps since I was a little kid and I have made a lot of projects.

## Programming languages
I have worked in many different programming languages.

I started learning `Fortran` because that was what my father could teach me. Then I moved on to `bash`,`html`, `css` and `javascript`, when I created my first web site what I was in junior highschool since I wanted the server to update on its own without me having to do it manually. After that I started programming a fiew apps on `.NET`. 

Then I went to the university, where I was taught `python`, `java`, `C` (I also started learning `C++`) an I started learning some php because I wanted to do a fiew projcts that would make my life at the university a bit easier. They also taught us how to programm in `Haskell` and `Prolog`, but unlike the other programming languages, I did not go any deeper because I did not believe that any of that would really be helpfull to me.
